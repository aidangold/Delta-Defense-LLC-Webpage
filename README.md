# Delta-Defense-LLC-Webpage
Created for interview purposes


This is a basic webpage with content and look based on the provided screen shot from Delta Defense LLC. Some aspects of this webpage are lacking I am fully aware. Some brushing up on media query and CSS is warranted.

The use of rem (which is a root scale) is used to create dynamic scaling with the size of elements on this page. It's a little wonky due to me not setting the font size to 62.5% (which rem is based on) as I didn't realize this until after. It would be unfair for me to spend much more than the allotted time (3-5 hours, per the instructions) on this webpage.

I will be happy to talk about my process in the follow up interview, maybe both parties can learn something.
